## Welcome to Econ 106

**Data Analysis in Economics â€“ Fall 2024**  
Based on: [R Ecology Lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/introduction-r-rstudio.html)

---

## Outline

- Class Overview
- Intro to R
- RStudio Console
- Operators
- Functions
- Objects

---

## Data Is Everywhere

- In 2015, healthcare alone produced 1.2 billion clinical documents.
- Digital forms, social media, online portals, reports, emails, messages = data explosion.
- Source: Holmes (2017), _Big Data: A Very Short Introduction_

---

## Why Work With Data?

- **Jobs**: Data analysts are in demand
- Emphasize interpretation and communication
- Data literacy = understanding + working with data to generate insight

---

## Who Is This Class For?

- Students interested in:
  - Research assistant work
  - Conducting empirical analyses
  - Data Science careers
- Prerequisite: Econ 101
- No programming experience required

---

## Course Objectives

- Collect, process, and analyze data using R
- Visualize and communicate findings
- Present results clearly to diverse audiences

---

## Why Use R?

- Free, open source
- Widely used in academia and industry
- Built for statistics and visualization

---

## R vs. Python

- **R**: Better at econometrics and graphics
- **Python**: Better at machine learning and software development

---

## Philosophy

- Itâ€™s not about syntax â€” itâ€™s about **thinking with data**
- Choose the best tool for the job
- Youâ€™ll eventually learn both R and Python

---

## Course Grading

- Labs: 40%
- Project Milestones: 30%
- Final Project: 20%
- Poll Everywhere: 10%

---

## Labs

- Practice skills from lecture
- Components: write-up + R script
- Due: Sundays @ 11:59 PM
- Lowest lab dropped

---

## Research Project

- Design and execute your own small research project
- Includes 3 milestones
- Final product:
  - 1500-word write-up
  - Documentation (R scripts)

---

## Lecture Logistics

- ChatGPT is OK for code (must document use)
- Not allowed for write-up or milestones

---

## Lecture Quizzes

- Posted on Canvas (ungraded)
- Useful for practice
- Can ask questions during lab

---

## Lecture Scripts

- All lecture code posted to Canvas
- Use it during and after lecture

---

## This Week: R Basics

- Learn the foundations before moving to data wrangling and visualization

---

## Coding Goals

1. Code runs without errors
2. Code does what you expect
3. You understand how it works

---

## Getting Help

- Read error messages
- Use Stack Overflow, ChatGPT, or Slack
- Ask the instructor or TA

---

## Be Precise

```r
data_rocks <- 2^3
datarocks     # Error: object not found
Data_rocks    # Error: object not found
```

---

## What is R and RStudio?

- **R**: A programming language
- **RStudio**: An interface to write and run R code

---

## RStudio Interface

- Console, script editor, environment, file pane

---

## Writing Code in Scripts

- Save with `.R` extension
- Run line-by-line with `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`

---

## Comments

```r
# This is a comment
# R ignores anything after the #
```

---

## Letâ€™s Start Coding!

- Operators tell R what to do

---

## Arithmetic Operators

```r
2 + 2      # add
3 - 1      # subtract
4 * 4      # multiply
5 / 2      # divide
5 ^ 2      # exponent
```

---

## Tip Example

```r
# Loubertoâ€™s tip
bill_louberto <- 25
tip_louberto <- 0.15 * bill_louberto

# Louieâ€™s tip
bill_louie <- 32
tip_louie <- 0.12 * bill_louie
```

---

## Functions

```r
round(x = 3.14159, digits = 0)
round(3.14159)  # digits is optional
```

---

## Assignment Operator

```r
weight_kg <- 55
weight_lb <- weight_kg * 2.2
```

---

## Naming Objects

```r
# Good
weight_kg <- 55

# Not good
weightkg! <- 55
weight in kg <- 55
```

---

## Viewing Objects

```r
ls()
objects()
weight_kg
```

---

## Removing Objects

```r
rm(y)             # remove y
rm(list = ls())   # clear all
```

---

## Data Types

- Numeric (e.g. 55)
- Character (e.g. "hello")
