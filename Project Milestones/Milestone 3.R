##Template for Research Project Milestone 3


#load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)

##set your working directory to the location of your data file



##read in your data file (easiest to load if it is saved as a csv file)



#tidy your data as needed (join, reshape, etc.)



##Categorical Data Cleaning####


#categorical variable 1 (repeat for all 4 categorical variables)

#convert to factor variable


#report the current number of levels


#list the current levels 


#collapse the levels to no more than 5 


#order the levels if the categorical data is ordinal


#create a frequency table (dyplr)


#create a bar plot (ordered by frequency if the categorical variable is not ordinal)


##Quantitative Data Cleaning####


#quantitative variable 1 (repeat for all 4 quantitative variables)

#check how it's stored (character, numeric, etc.) and convert as needed


#create a summary table with n, min, mean, median, and max (dplyr)


#create a density plot or histogram



#Five visualizations (includes the following elements)
#minimum of two variables per visualization
#minimum 2 visualizations with at least 3 variables each
#must use at least 6 out of your 8 variables

# Bar plot 
#density plot or histogram
#scatter plot or line graph 
#box plot 
#faceting 
#color mapping
